# ESP8266 UART Driver for Humans

If you've ever tried to use the UART driver bundled with the ESP8266 Non-OS SDK you know how painful it can be to use that pile of turd. This project tries to bring sanity and simplicity to all that crap.

## Usage

To use this driver correctly simply add it to your project like you normally would with any C source and header file that is already in your project, then adjust your Makefile to compile it with your project, and you should be good to go.
